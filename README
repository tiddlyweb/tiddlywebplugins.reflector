First stab at tiddlywebplugins.reflector, a reflector
plugin idea from Ben Gillies:

* Post a file to the reflector and it gets returned to the
  browser with the content-type it was given.
* If you put the sending form in an iframe, then you can
  gather up the content of the iframe and give it to 
  tiddlywiki for use in the import routines.

This first stab doesn't do much in the way of error 
trapping yet. It may also have issues with caching.
